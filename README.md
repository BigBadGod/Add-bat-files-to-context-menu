# Add-bat-files-to-context-menu
A simple bat file to add any other bat file you want, to the context menu.

Here is how to use it:
The first time you run it, it makes a folder and asks you to copy any bat file you want to add to the context menu, inside of that folder.
Then you run it again, and that's it. It adds your bat files to the context menu by adding the needed key to the registry,
makes a "Scripts" folder in you C drive and add your bat files inside there in folders with the same name of your bats,
and finally it generates necesary files inside those folders to uninstall each one.
If you don't want the bat in your context menu, just head to "C:\Scripts\your bat folder name" and run the uninstall.bat file.
Done and Done.
Hope it be helpfull to you all.
Any suggestion and guidence would be greately appretiated, since I'm a rooky and realy looking forward to learn more and more.
